# YouTube Spam Detection
YouTube comment spam detection is a crucial component of maintaining a healthy and engaging online community. It refers to the process of identifying and filtering out spammy or irrelevant comments on YouTube videos.
In this project we have used https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/images dataset.
After loding the dataset the content is passed through CountVectorizer which will remove the stopword and count the number occurances of words which will help in determining if it is spam or not.
We have used multiple Machine Learning algorithm like Logistic Regression, SVC, Decision tree, random forest, Kneighbour Classifier and Bernoulli Naive Bayes.
Outof which Bernoulli Naive Bayes give highest accuracy of 99.0476%.
